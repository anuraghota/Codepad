##Setup-

If you have any problem regarding Github setup, please read-
[GitHub Setup](http://crunchify.com/how-to-fork-github-repository-create-pull-request-and-merge/)


##Workflow-

####1. Text-Editor - 
   We should finalise the text editor by March 8th and then we can go on to work with it.
   **Requirements- Python, Application Deployment, Qt (Incase we work with Enki)**

####2. Data-Files -
   Start a discussion in the google group regarding this. We need to collect documentation for all(as far as we can go)     functions in the basic programming languages( C, C++, Java, Python).
   The next job would be to preprocess the data and structure it accordingly.
   **Requirements - Python, Pyparsing**

####3. IR-Model -
   Unless the Data-Files are collected, this cannot be worked upon. But a sample data can be used to see the              accuracy,precision of the IR-Model implemented.
   
   **Requirements - Knowledge of Information Retrieval**
